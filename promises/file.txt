Arduino is an open source, computer hardware and software company, project, and user community that
designs and manufactures single-board microcontrollers and microcontroller kits for building digital
devices and interactive objects that can sense and control objects in the physical world.
The project's products are distributed as open-source hardware and software, which are licensed
under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) or the GNU General Public License (GPL),[1]
permitting the manufacture of Arduino boards and software distribution by anyone. Arduino boards
are available commercially in preassembled form, or as do-it-yourself kits.

Arduino board designs use a variety of microprocessors and controllers. The boards are equipped
with sets of digital and analog input/output (I/O) pins that may be interfaced to various
expansion boards (shields) and other circuits. The boards feature serial communications
interfaces, including Universal Serial Bus (USB) on some models, which are also used for
loading programs from personal computers. The microcontrollers are typically programmed
using a dialect of features from the programming languages C and C++. In addition to using
 traditional compiler toolchains, the Arduino project provides an integrated development
 environment (IDE) based on the Processing language project.

The Arduino project started in 2003 as a program for students at the Interaction Design
Institute Ivrea in Ivrea, Italy,[2] aiming to provide a low-cost and easy way for novices
and professionals to create devices that interact with their environment using sensors and
 actuators. Common examples of such devices intended for beginner hobbyists include simple
 robots, thermostats, and motion detectors.

The name Arduino comes from a bar in Ivrea, Italy, where some of the founders of the project
 used to meet. The bar was named after Arduin of Ivrea, who was the margrave of the March of
 Ivrea and King of Italy from 1002 to 1014.[3]
